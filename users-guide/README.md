# User's Guide

## Building

This user's guide can be built with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook)
into a website with the command:

    mdbook build

## Development

You can develop the users guide with the command:

    mdbook serve

This will then run a server which watches for changes, rebuilds the website when
something changes, and hosts it. By default this is at http://localhost:3000/ .
